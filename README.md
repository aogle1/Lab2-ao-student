# Questions

- What is the complexity of each of the four search methods in terms of array or list size n?
1. Linear Array: best time complexity when Accessing.
2. Linear List: best time complexity with Assertion and Deletion. 
3. Linear 
4. Binary Array: good time complexity across the board. 
- What happens in the case of binary search if the array is not sorted?
When the array isn’t sorted for binary search think about the assumptions you’re making when you divide the array in half and look at the left and right of the middle of the array would not work due to it not being sorted. The constraint would be broken and it could infinetly run or not find what you are looking for. 
- What is the purpose of constructor argument validity checking?
Validity checking ensures the correct variable that is being searched for is found as opposed to null. 
- What is the purpose of using the keyword `final` with variables and arguments?
Final methods can not be overriden by subclasses. This ensures that important base class methods cannot be overridden by their children. In addition final variables can only be created once.
- What are alternatives to using `Optional` and how do they compare?
  Null is an alternative with this you have to check repeatedly for null values as the conflict with exceptions.
